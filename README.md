## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL
  [https://www.postgresql.org/](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- MailDev
  [https://github.com/maildev/maildev](https://github.com/maildev/maildev)

### Install dependencies

Install NPM packages:

```
npm install
```

### Configure environment variables

For local development, you'll need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project to define the environment variables. This file is ignored by Git, so the secrets will not be committed to the repository.

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/halcyon-next

EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER=localhost
EMAIL_SMTP_PORT=1025
EMAIL_SMTP_SSL=
EMAIL_SMTP_USERNAME=
EMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD=
EMAIL_NO_REPLY_ADDRESS=noreply@example.com

SEED_EMAIL_ADDRESS=system.administrator@example.com
SEED_PASSWORD=super_secret_password_that_should_be_changed

SESSION_DURATION=3600
SESSION_SECRET=super_secret_key_that_should_be_changed
```

### Running the development server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the project running.

## Building for Production

To build the project for production:

```
npm run build
```

This command will create an optimized build in the `.next` folder.

## Linting & Formatting

To lint and format the code:

```
npm run lint
npm run format
